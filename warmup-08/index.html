      <p>Social links will have padding within their hidden bar. Might adjust the pixels required for the image margin,
        as they seem a bit small and I didn't have time to test them today. Will have links change when hovered over,
        probably a different color background and text. Also thinking I might change the banner image into the literal
        website banner and see if that would make the design better, but I guess I'll know when I come to it.
        Also the social link bar will also be fixed.Overall, really rough and might be completely different by
        the time I'm finished with it.</p>
