      <p>Based in Italy, this company has been resposible for several very popular games,
        and has been active for little over 17 years. Personally I like their logo,
        and decided to make a custom background to match the colors. Not sure if its perfect
        but I think its pretty close. I'm also testing a new css element on fixing the background
        so it doesn't move when you scroll, so we'll see if that works.</p>
