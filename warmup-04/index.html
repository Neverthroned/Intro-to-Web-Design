      <p>Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies
      The sun is shining in the sky
      There ain't a cloud in sight
      It's stopped raining
      Everybody's in the play
      And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day
      Hey, hey, hey!
      Running down the avenue
      See how the sun shines brightly in the city
      All the streets where once was pity
      Mr. Blue Sky is living here today!
      Hey, hey, hey!
      Mr. Blue Sky
      Please tell us why
      You had to hide away for so long (so long)
      Where did we go wrong?
      Mr. Blue Sky
      Please tell us why
      You had to hide away for so long (so long)
      Where did we go wrong?
      Hey, you with the pretty face
      Welcome to the human race!
      A celebration
      Mr. Blue Sky's up there waiting
      And today is the day we've waited for
      Ah, ah, ah
      Oh, Mr. Blue Sky
      Please tell us why
      You had to hide away for so long (so long)
      Where did we go wrong?
      Hey there Mr. Blue!
      We're so pleased to be with you
      Look around, see what you do
      Everybody smiles at you
      Hey there Mr. Blue!
      We're so pleased to be with you
      Look around, see what you do
      Everybody smiles at you!
      Mr. Blue Sky
      Mr. Blue Sky
      Mr. Blue Sky
      Mr. Blue, you did it right
      But soon comes Mr. Night
      Creeping over, now his hand is on your shoulder
      Never mind, I'll remember you this
      I'll remember you this way!
      Mr. Blue Sky
      Please tell us why
      You had to hide away for so long (so long)
      Where did we go wrong?
      Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)
      We're so pleased to be with you (sky)
      Look around see what you do (blue)
      Everybody smiles at you
      Please turn me over</p>
