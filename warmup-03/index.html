    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <!-- I'm getting hungry while typing this -->
    <ol>
      <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper and dust
        and dust with a light, even coating of flour. In one shallow bowl,
        beat the agg. Put the panko into another shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>Add thin, even layer of oil to a cast iron pan or skillet over
        meduim heat. The oil is ready when you throw a panko breadcrumb
        into the oil and it sizzles. Dip the pork into the egg to coat.
        Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat
        to get a good coating.</li>
      <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for <b>5-6
        minutes</b> on one side, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other
        side for another <b>5-6 minutes.</b> Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
      <li>While the pork is resting, add the stock, sugar, soy sauce,
        and Mirin to a small bowl. In another bowl, lightly beat two eggs.
        Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan over meduim heat, and agg the sliced
        onion. fry the onions until they're translucent and slightly
        carmelized</li>
      <li>Pour the stock mixture over the onions. Slice your tonkatsu
        into pieces and place on top of the onions. Drizzle the
        egg over everything. Cook over meduim low heat until the
        egg is just set. Serve over bowls of steamed rice, and garnish
        with scallions.</li>
