      <p><b class="styled">R</b>ight afterwards, when the Buddha had retired for the
        night, Govinda turned to Siddhartha and spoke eagerly:
        “Siddhartha, it is not my place to scold you. We have
        both heard the exalted one, be have both perceived the
        teachings. Govinda has heard the teachings, he has
        taken refuge in it. But you, my honoured friend, don’t
        you also want to walk the path of salvation? Would you
        want to hesitate, do you want to wait any longer?”
        Siddhartha awakened as if he had been asleep, when
        he heard Govinda’s words. For a long tome, he looked
        into Govinda’s face. Then he spoke quietly, in a voice
        without mockery: “Govinda, my friend, now you have
        taken this step, now you have chosen this path. Always, oh Govinda, you’ve been my friend, you’ve always walked one step behind me. Often I have thought:
        Won’t Govinda for once also take a step by himself,
        without me, out of his own soul? Behold, now you’ve
        turned into a man and are choosing your path for yourself. I wish that you would go it up to its end, oh my
        friend, that you shall find salvation!”</p>
      <p><b class="styled">G</b>ovinda, not completely understanding it yet, repeated his question in an impatient tone: “Speak up,
        I beg you, my dear! Tell me, since it could not be any
        other way, that you also, my learned friend, will take
        your refuge with the exalted Buddha!”
        Siddhartha placed his hand on Govinda’s shoulder:
        “You failed to hear my good wish for you, oh Govinda.
        I’m repeating it: I wish that you would go this path up
        to its end, that you shall find salvation!”
        In this moment, Govinda realized that his friend had
        left him, and he started to weep.
        “Siddhartha!” he exclaimed lamentingly.
        Siddhartha kindly spoke to him: “Don’t forget,
        Govinda, that you are now one of the Samanas of the
        Buddha! You have renounced your home and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced
        your free will, renounced all friendship. This is what
        the teachings require, this is what the exalted one wants.
        This is what you wanted for yourself. Tomorrow, oh
        Govinda, I’ll leave you.</p>
