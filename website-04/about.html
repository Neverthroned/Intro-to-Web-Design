      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Yo, I'm Bridger, a current sophmore trying to get a bachelor's in media arts at the University of Montana. I have a sister and two dogs, and am really happy to live
        in a super small town (that gets several feet of snow each year). I love art, drawing, anything that requires a canvas, whether it be a physical, or digital one.
        I also love video games, and love to learn about the people who made them, as well as how they work. I realized that media arts was the path for me if I wanted to make a career
        out of my passions, and that brings me to where I am today.<br><br>
        Personally, can't wait to graduate, and am looking forward to the future. Here's to making more art!</p>
