I've taken a web design class in the past, however I'm a bit rusty, and seeing as how this helps me along the path to becoming a game designer, I decided to take this.

I hope to learn more about web design in general. As stated, I've previously taken a course similar to this, but since that was in highschool, I expect to gain more insight and knowledge, as well as refresh my skills.

The image file I uploaded is my attempt at photorealism, not perfect but I really enjoyed making it. I'm an artist, and I especially love drawing unique creatures, that one being a jumping spider.
